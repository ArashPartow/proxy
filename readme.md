#### Description
The C++ TCP Proxy server is a simple utility using the ASIO networking library,
for proxying (tunneling or redirecting) connections from external clients to a
specific server. The TCP Proxy server can be used to easily and efficiently:

+ Limit the number of client connections to the server
+ Load balance client connections between multiple server instances
+ Provide IP or connection time based filtering and access control mechanisms
